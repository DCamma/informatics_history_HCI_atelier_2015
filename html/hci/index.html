<h1>HCI - Human computer interaction</h1>

<b>Human–computer interaction (HCI)</b> researches the design and use of computer technology, focusing particularly on the interfaces between people (users) and computers. Researchers in the field of HCI both observe the ways in which humans interact with computers and design technologies that lets humans interact with computers in novel ways. The interface is crucial to facilitating the interaction between humans and the computers. 
<br>
<b>CHI (Computer-Human Interaction)</b> here has a narrower focus than HCI; CHI is associated mainly with computer science.

<h1>HF&E - Human factors and ergonomics</h1>

<b>Human factors and ergonomics (HF&E)</b>, also known as comfort design, functional design, and user-friendly systems, is the practice of designing products, systems or processes to take proper account of the interaction between them and the people who use them. 
The International Ergonomics Association defines HF&E as follows:
“Ergonomics (or human factors) is the scientific discipline concerned with the understanding of interactions among humans and other elements of a system, and the profession that applies theory, principles, data and methods to design in order to optimize human well-being and overall system performance.”

		<h1>Future of HCI - A glimpse on the future</h1><br>

		The pervasive computing is the growing trend of embedding processors in everyday life objects.
		The main goal of pervasive computing is to make the technology simple to use and present everywhere in order to
		integrate the physical word with the virtual world.
		Mark Weiser, a chief scientist at Xerox PARC, coined the term in 1988 and almost 30 years later we are witnessing 
		a third wave in computing. First there were the mainframes, each shared by lots of people. Then personal computer arrived and every person had the possibility
		to use a computer at home, school and so on.
		Finally we are going to a world where there are many tiny digital devices for each person, all around him.<br>

		Mark Weiser proposed three categories of pervasive system devices:
		- Table: wearable centimetre sized devices
		- Pads: Hand-held decimetre sized devices
		- Boards: Metre sized interactive display devices<br>
