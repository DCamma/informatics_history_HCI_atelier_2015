<h1>HCI - Human computer interaction</h1>

<b>Human–computer interaction (HCI)</b> researches the design and use of computer technology, focusing particularly on the interfaces between people (users) and computers. Researchers in the field of HCI both observe the ways in which humans interact with computers and design technologies that lets humans interact with computers in novel ways. The interface is crucial to facilitating the interaction between humans and the computers.

<b>CHI (Computer-Human Interaction)</b> here has a narrower focus than HCI; CHI is associated mainly with computer science.

<h1>HF&E - Human factors and ergonomics</h1>

<b>Human factors and ergonomics (HF&E)</b>, also known as comfort design, functional design, and user-friendly systems, is the practice of designing products, systems or processes to take proper account of the interaction between them and the people who use them. 
The International Ergonomics Association defines HF&E as follows:
“Ergonomics (or human factors) is the scientific discipline concerned with the understanding of interactions among humans and other elements of a system, and the profession that applies theory, principles, data and methods to design in order to optimize human well-being and overall system performance.”
