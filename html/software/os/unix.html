				<p> The creation of the <a href="../../software/os/os.html">operating system</a> <b>UNIX</b> began as <b>Bell Labs</b> withdrew from the <b>Multics</b> (Multiplexed Information and Computing Service) project in 1969. <a href="../../software/companies_people/thompson.html">Ken Thompson</a> and <a href="../../software/companies_people/ritchie.html">Dennis Ritchie</a> were among a few who had worked on the
				project and they were part of a small team that wanted to find an alternative operating system that included the desirable 
				features of Multics. Thus began the creation of UNIX.

				<p>The first edition of UNIX was released in 1971, it was used on a DEC PDP-7.
				UNIX's power and flexibility made it very popular, newer versions 
				were released shortly after.
				A major breakthrough was made in the fourth edition of UNIX in 1973, as it 
				was now being written in 
				<a href="../../software/software_engineering/languages/most_important_pl.html">C</a>,
				 making it portable (it could be installed in
				almost any computer and translated to the language used in that computer).
				UNIX was also relatively inexpensive, which helped popularizing it as an operating system.
				</p>
				
				<p>In 1975, UNIX version 6 was released: the first version
				that could be readily modified by a user. It used the 
				<b>Thompson shell</b>, which would later inspire the interactive <b>C shell</b>.
				</p>

				<h2>Variations and Open Systems</h2>
				<!-- CHANGE THE NUMBER IN THE <sup></sup> TAGS EACH TIME -->
				During the 1980's, competition between different UNIX
				system products soared, resulting in many new versions of UNIX 
				with diffrent features.
				<p><a href="../../software/os/xenix.html">XENIX</a> 
				is one of the most well known variations of the UNIX system: it was created in 1980 by <a href="../../software/companies_people/microsoft.html">Microsoft</a>. 
				In the same year, <b>BSD</b> (Berkeley Software Distribution) released 
				the fourth version of its own distribution of UNIX, called <b>4BSD</b>. AT&amp;T and Bell Labs split during this time period, dividing the UNIX system into different variations once again.
				</p>
				<p>
				<b>UNIX was futher popularized as X/Open Company Ltd</b> used it as the basis of its open systems, which meet specific standards independent of the supplier. In 1987, <b>AT&amp;T</b> along with Berkeley founded
				the <b>OSF</b>(Open Software Foundation), an open system.
				During the late 1980's there was immense competition between suppliers of 
				AT&amp;T's UNIX System V and OSF's UNIX based open systems. By 1991, a new company was formed: <b>UNIX System Laboratories</b>. Around
				this period, early versions of <b>Linux</b> (an operating system based on UNIX)
				and <b>Solaris</b> (a version of UNIX for <b>SPARC</b>) were being developed.
